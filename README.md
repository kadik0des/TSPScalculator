# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

My learning focus for this project was to get hands-on experience with the JS concepts learned. I used the Zell Liew Calculator tutorial as guidance to code along. 

# Optimizations

When I optimize this project, I would add more mathematical operators to allow for a more robust and well-rounded calculator that can be used by anyone for anything. Also add in media queries so that it can be used on all screen sizes. 

# Lessons Learned:

This project showed me that there is so much to learn when it comes to Javascript. It allowed me to get see what code looks like with and without OOP concepts implemented and why they are so important.
